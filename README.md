# Project Overview
This research investigates how wellness marketing and labeling, specifically the USDA "organic", affects profitability in the United States dairy industry. Using data from the 2005, 2010, and 2016 USDA ARMS surveys, the analysis compares organic versus conventional milk production to determine whether wellness-driven price premiums translate into higher farm-level profits.
This repository contains all data, scripts, visuals, and documentation used to clean data, run regressions, generate models, and visualize trends in milk value, costs, and profitability.
# Goals
- Answer the guiding research question: What type of impact does wellness marketing and labeling, like “organic”, have on businesses in the United States?
- What type of impact does wellness marketing and labeling, like “organic”, have on businesses in the United States.
- Understand how wellness labels influence price, consumer perception, and economic outcomes.
# Project Structure
The repository is organized to keep data, code, figures, and results clear and reproducible.
1. Folder descriptions:
   - data: Contains all raw and cleaned USDA ARMS datasets used for this project. Files are stored as downloaded and never overwritten by scripts.
   - experiments: Used for exploratory data analysis, early regression testing, and trial visualizations during development.
   - figures: Stores all plots generated by the analysis, including, milk price trend plots (Organic vs Conventional), profit trend scatterplots, residual distributions, partial regression (added-variable) plots.
   - one_time_scripts: Scripts used for initial setup: data download, merging multi-table Excel files, creating state mappings, and reshaping wide-to-long.
   - results: Contains all regression outputs, formatted model summaries, cleaned result tables, and any exported statistical results.
   - utilities: Reusable functions for data cleaning, column standardization, long-to-wide transformations, plotting templates, and regression models
   - main.ipynb: Central analysis file combining data import, cleaning, regression modeling, and visualization.
   - README.md: The main documentation file summarizing the project, results, and structure.
# Sources
Primary data sources and literature referenced in this project include:
- USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) Organic Costs & Returns datasets (2005, 2010, 2016)
- USDA Agricultural Marketing Service labeling regulations
- Academic studies on:
  a) Organic price premiums
  b) Consumer psychology and the organic halo effect
  c) Cost structures of organic vs conventional dairy farming
  d) Wellness labeling economics
# Data
The project uses publicly available ARMS dairy datasets from the USDA-ERS. Key variables include:
- milk_sold – value of milk sold ($/cwt)
- gross_value – total gross value of production
- feed_costs – total feed costs
- operating_costs – operating expenses
- overhead – overhead and allocated capital
- total_costs – full production cost
- cows_per_farm, output_per_cow – production scale indicators
- Organic – binary (1 = organic, 0 = conventional)
- profit – derived variable = gross_value − total_costs
States included across all three survey years (selected for consistency):
- Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Wisconsin.
# Methods
1) Research design: Observational, non-experimental
2) Statistical Approach: Multiple Linear Regression
  a) Model 1: profit ~ organic_bin
    - estimates raw organic–profit relationship
  b) Model 2 (controlled): profit ~ organic_bin + feed_costs + operating_costs + overhead
    - measures organic effect after accounting for cost differences
3) Assumption Checks:
   a) Residual histograms & KDE
   b) Residuals vs. fitted plots
   c) Partial regression (added-variable) plots
   d) Variance and normality diagnostics
# Results
1) Model 1 – Profit Model
   - Organic coefficient: –5.35
   - Interpretation: Organic farms appear less profitable by about $5.35/cwt.
   - r-sqaured = 0.338
   - Residuals approximately normal.
2) Model 2 - Controlled Profit Model
   - Organic coefficient: 6.61
   - Interpretation: When feed, operating, and overhead costs are included, organic production becomes more profitable than conventional.
   - r-sqaured = 0.746
   - Stronger model fit and valid residual structure.
# Meaning
This project contributes to the economics of wellness marketing by showing:
- Wellness labels like “organic” meaningfully impact farm-level profitability.
- Consumer driven price premiums can offset production costs.
- Cost structures must be accounted for to understand organic profitability.
- Organic production may remain financially viable despite higher regulatory and labor requirements.
- These insights help bridge consumer behavior, agricultural economics, and marketing.

# Tool & Libraries
1) Python — primary programming language
2) Pandas — data cleaning and merging 
3) NumPy — numerical operations and array manipulation
4) Matplotlib — core plotting for trends and diagnostics
5) Seaborn — statistical visualization (histograms, KDE, scatterplots)
6) Statsmodels — OLS regression modeling and diagnostic plots
7) Jupyter Notebook — analysis orchestration and documentation
# Conclusion
This project finds that while organic milk appears less profitable when examined alone, organic dairy farms outperform conventional farms once cost differences are removed. The findings highlight the financial significance of wellness marketing and organic labeling in the U.S. food system. Organic farming’s economic success depends not only on price premiums but also on managing higher operational costs. This study reinforces that wellness labeling can create meaningful financial value when understood through the lens of cost-adjusted profitability.
