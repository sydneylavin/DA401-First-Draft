# Project Overview
This research investigates how wellness marketing and labeling, specifically the USDA "organic", affects profitability in the United States dairy industry. Using data from the 2005, 2010, and 2016 USDA ARMS surveys, the analysis compares organic versus conventional milk production to determine whether wellness-driven price premiums translate into higher farm-level profits. All monetary values were adjusted for inflation and expressed in constant 2005 dollars using the BLS Consumer Price Index for dairy and related products to ensure comparability across survey years. In addition to profitability, the analysis evaluates whether organic production is associated with higher milk sales independent of cost structure.
This repository contains all data, scripts, visuals, and documentation used to clean data, run regressions, generate models, and visualize trends in milk value, costs, and profitability.
# Goals

# Sources
Primary data sources and literature referenced in this project include:
- USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) Organic Costs & Returns datasets (2005, 2010, 2016)
- USDA Agricultural Marketing Service labeling regulations
- BLS Consumer Price Index (FRED)
- Academic studies on:
  a) Organic price premiums
  b) Consumer psychology and the organic halo effect
  c) Cost structures of organic vs conventional dairy farming
  d) Wellness labeling economics
# Data
The project uses publicly available ARMS dairy datasets from the USDA-ERS. Key variables include:
- milk_sold – value of milk sold ($/cwt)
- gross_value – total gross value of production
- feed_costs – total feed costs
- vet_costs - total veterinary and medicine costs
- bedding_litter costs - total bedding and litter costs
- marketing_costs - expenses associated with marketing and promotion
- service_costs - total custom service costs
- utility_costs - total fuel, lube, and electricity costs 
- repair_costs - total repair costs
- total_operating_costs – total operating expenses
- overhead – overhead and allocated capital
- total_costs – full production cost
- cows_per_farm, output_per_cow – production scale indicators
- Organic – binary (1 = organic, 0 = conventional)
- profit – derived variable = gross_value − total_costs
States included across all three survey years (selected for consistency):
- Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Wisconsin.
To control for changing economic conditions over time, all nominal price and cost variables were deflated to real 2005 dollars using dairy-specific CPI data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database.
# Methods
1) Research design: Observational, non-experimental
2) Statistical Approach: Multiple Linear Regression
  a) Model 1: profit ~ organic_bin
    - estimates raw organic–profit relationship
  b) Model 2 (controlled): profit ~ organic_bin + feed_costs + operating_costs + overhead
    - measures organic effect after accounting for cost differences
3) Assumption Checks:
   a) Residual histograms & KDE
   b) Residuals vs. fitted plots
   c) Partial regression (added-variable) plots
   d) Variance and normality diagnostics
4) A final sales regression model was estimated to assess whether organic production predicts higher real milk sales per hundredweight while holding operating costs constant.
# Results
1) Model 1 – Profit Model
   - Organic coefficient: –5.10
   - Interpretation: Organic farms appear less profitable by about $5.10/cwt.
   - r-sqaured = 0.347
   - Residuals approximately normal.
2) Model 2 - Controlled Profit Model
   - Organic coefficient: 8.636
   - Interpretation: When feed, operating, and overhead costs are included, organic production becomes more profitable than conventional.
   - r-sqaured = 0.881
   - Stronger model fit and valid residual structure.
3) Model 3 - Sales Model
   - Organic coefficent = 8.01
   - Feed costs coefficient = 0.696
   - Repair costs coefficient = 3.806
   - Interpretation: When controlling for costs, organic milk production is associated with higher sales.
   - r-squared = 0.927
   - Model is highly explanatory of the variation in milk sales across organic and conventional farms.
# Meaning
This project contributes to the economics of wellness marketing by showing:
- Wellness labels like “organic” meaningfully impact farm-level profitability.
- Consumer driven price premiums can offset production costs.
- Cost structures must be accounted for to understand organic profitability.
- Organic production may remain financially viable despite higher regulatory and labor requirements.
- These insights help bridge consumer behavior, agricultural economics, and marketing.
- The results indicate that organic dairy farms do not underperform in sales; rather, differences in profitability are primarily driven by higher production costs.
- These findings support existing literature on wellness marketing by showing that consumer-driven price premiums translate into higher farm-level revenue.

# Conclusion
The first regression model suggested that organic milk production led to significantly lower profits, which aligns with prior evidence that organic farms face higher production and regulatory costs. However, once feed, bedding and litter, marketing, service, utility, repair, and overhead costs were incorporated into the model, the relationship reversed. Organic milk production became significantly more profitable than conventional milk. These findings indicate that although organic products may appear less profitable when examined upfront, the higher profits generated by wellness-driven price premiums can outweigh cost differences when properly accounted for. This led into the final model which focused on sales instead of profit. The sales model suggested that organic milk production is associated with higher sales than conventional farms, even when those same cost variables are held constant. This shows that organic labeling, in combination with operational inputs, are associated with higher milk sales. Overall, the analysis highlights the economic significance of wellness marketing and labeling in the dairy sector and reinforces the role of consumer perception in shaping farm-level financial outcomes.
# Limitations
The analysis relies on observational survey data. This limits the ability to draw causal conclusions about the relationship between organic production and profit because there are factors like management ability or regional differences that could influence profitability but are not captured in the dataset. Additionally, profit calculations depend on self-reported costs and revenues. This could introduce measurement error or reporting bias. Furthermore, the data are drawn from only three survey years and, while they cover a relatively long time span (2005-2016), this limits time variation. It also only focuses on five U.S. states which results in a relatively small sample of 30 observations, consisting of 15 organic and 15 conventional farms. These factors can limit the ability to evaluate how profitability trends may have changed over time.
# Future Steps
There are many different directions that future research could build on this study. More detailed cost modeling could examine additional components of organic production, such as the costs and time required to obtain organic certification, to better understand cost drivers. Future research could investigate different states nationwide to look at overall trends in the market. Additionally, research could also incorporate different commodities such as eggs to see if the trends persist into different categories. This would enhance generalizability. Furthermore, gathering consumer data would strengthen the understanding of how wellness marketing impacts business economically.
